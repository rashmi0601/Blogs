# README

This blog platform operates with two distinct user roles: admin and user. It features essential user authentication and empowers users to upload images or files with their blog posts. Importantly, all posts must receive admin approval before becoming visible to the entire user base. Admins possess the decisive authority to approve or reject blog posts. Once an admin approves a blog post, it is promptly made visible to all users.
